Hi, my name is Ethan Dias Alberto and welcome to my github page. 

I'm currently learning and developing in python but aspire to learn a wider range of technologies in order to broaden my understanding of full-stack development and software engineering as a whole.

My current project is a simple program to update stocks and take inventory of an eBay page, in a csv file.
