# About me
Hi, my name is Ethan Dias Alberto and welcome to my github page. 

I'm currently learning and developing in C++ and JavaScript but aspire to learn a wider range of technologies in order to broaden my understanding of full-stack development and software engineering as a whole.

## Familiar Technologies:
- Python
- HTML
- JavaScript
- C++
- ArduinoC
- Discord bot API
- Websockets

## Current Project(s):
Some form of e-commerce site, effectively an eBay duplicate, without actual commercial capability for security reasons.
