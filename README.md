# About me
Hi, my name is Ethan Dias Alberto! I'm currently a university student studying Computer Science, but I love exploring the field in my own time.
I have experience with full-stack web development, ArduinoC, Python and C, amongst other things, and I'm always eager to make the list grow! 

## Current Project(s):
- Peer-to-Peer means of hosting websites, with UDP holepunching
- Home server with high availability to self-host some services and websites
- Learning offensive cyber security through HackTheBox

##### Thanks for reading! Feel free to browse through my repositories (more coming soon)
